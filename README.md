# LitLog - *A reader's best friend*

## Purpose
The library management sysytem, **LitLog**, will allow users to efficiently organize and track their personal book collections. Users will be able to add books to their digital library, categorize them by genre or custom tags, update the reading status for each book (e.g., not started, in progress, completed), and receive reccomendations unique to their taste. Furthermore, users can rate th ebooks they have read, write personal reviews, and maintian a history of their reading journey. The system will also feature search and filtering options to help users quickly find books within their library.

This application is designed for avid readers, book collecters, or anyone who wants to keep track of their reading habits in a more structured way. It could be useful for book club members, students, or literature enthusiasts who want to document their experiences with each book. As a fellow reader myself, I believe it would be useful to have a system that not only tracks my reading progress, but also allows me to reflect on what I've read through reviews and ratings.
